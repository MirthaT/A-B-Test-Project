# Analyzing User Behavior for an Emerging Food Products Company

## Description:
In this project, I delve into understanding user behavior for an emerging food products company through a comprehensive analysis of user interactions with the company's application. The primary objective is to gain insights into user engagement, identify potential bottlenecks in the user journey, and evaluate the impact of design changes on user experience.

## Project Phases:

### Data Preparation and Verification: 
Examined the dataset to determine the number of events, users, and the time period covered. Ensured data completeness and reliability for analysis.
### Event Funnel Analysis: 
Analyzed the sequence of user events to identify the user journey and potential drop-off points. Calculated conversion rates to assess user engagement.
### Experimental Design: 
Implemented an A/A/B test to evaluate the impact of design changes on user behavior. Assessed the statistical significance of experimental results.
### Result Interpretation: 
Interpreted experimental findings to draw insights into user preferences and behavior. Communicated conclusions and recommendations to stakeholders.
